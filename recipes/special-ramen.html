        <h3>A nice way to make ordinary ramen special!"</h3>
        <p>Ramen is one of those meals that just hits the right spot when nothing else will.  
            This spin on ramen will elevate your comfort food to the utmost comfort!</p>

        <p>There are many variations on the classic instant ramen mix that claim to make it
            <em>fancy</em> or <em>supreme</em>, but I think that this version is the easiest,
            and potentialy most <strong>delicious</strong> variant.</p>

            <li> A packet of instant ramen</li>
