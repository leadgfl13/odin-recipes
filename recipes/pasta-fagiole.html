    <img src ="../images/pasta.jpeg" alt="A delicious bean soup!">

    <h3> This is a delicious bean based soup thats made using everyday ingredients!</h3>
    <p> I was first introduced to this soup by my grandmother, who is Italian.  This has 
        become a family staple, with everyone in the family having their own version
    </p>

    <p> In this recipe, I am going to introduce my version.  I like to think of my version
        as a bit more of a shortcut for time, without sacrificing any flavor!  I hope that
        you will feel confident enough to run with this and make your own version to pass on
        to your loved ones
    </p>

    <h2> Ingredients list:</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2> Directions:</h2>

        <ol>
            <li> <p> Then first step would be to practice mis en plas</p>
            <p>Dice up your onion, garlic, and bacon.  Slice your carrots and celery</p></li>
            <li> In a large soup pan, heat up the bottom with olive oil and meadium high heat, add your carrots and celery. Let it sweat until a bit tender, add salt.</li>
            <li> Then add the onion, let it cook until onion starts to look a little translucent.  Stir occasionally to prevent veggies from sticking</li>
            <li> By now the veggies should smell nice.  Add the bacon, and cook with the veggies.  Try not to let the veggies burn by this point</li>
            <li> Once the bacon is cooked, add the garlic and let simmer for about 1 minute, or until garlic is fragrant</li>
            <li> Once garlic is fragrant, add two of the three cans of cannelini beans.  Mash up the third can into a paste before adding</li>
            <li> After the beans have heated and mixed, add four cups of chicken broth, and let simmer for about 20 minutes</li>
            <li> While simmering, boil a pot of water and cook your past of preference.  I prefer shells</li>
            <li> You may optinally add a rind of paremsan cheese to give a bit more flavor to the broth</li>
            <li> For color, add 1 to 2 tbsps of tomato paste.  Taste, season with salt, and fresh parsely to taste</li>
            <li> Add the pasta to the soup in your serving bowl (DO NOT MIX, OTHERWISE PASTA WILL GET MUSHY) and enjoy!</li>
