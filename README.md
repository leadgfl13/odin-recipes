This is the README file for the first project on the odinproject, titled RECIPES.

This prokject will be used to showcase my basic skills using HTML.  I will be making a website using the HTML language to showcase a couple of recipies. I will be using ordered and unordered lists, bolded text, italicised text, pictures, headings, and multiple pages.

This is also an opportunity to practice cloning repositories in github, as well as using the command line to move, save, and edit directly to github.
